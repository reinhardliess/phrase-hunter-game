# JavaScript Techdegree Project #4: OOP Game Show App

## Description

I used JavaScript and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) to create a word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." When starting the game, a hidden, random phrase (of a list of five phrases) is chosen, and put onto the gameboard using placeholders. The player tries to guess a letter either by mouse or keyboard. The game tracks which phrases were guessed correctly and lets the player continue until all 5 phrases are guessed correctly.

Animate.css is used for animations.

## Installation

## Technologies Used

- ES6 Classes (OOP)

## Some additional coding conventions

- I tried to write the code as clear as possible; all class methods are commented, additional comments only when they seemed necessary
- Constants are all uppercase, spaced out with underscores for readability
